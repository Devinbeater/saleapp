## 📊 How It Works

### Workflow Example:

1. **Start of Day**
   - Enter Opening Cash: ₹5,000

2. **During Day - POS Entries**
   - Type "500" in POS cell
   - Modal appears → Select "Sale"
   - Badge shows "SALE" on the cell
   - Total Sale updates to ₹500

3. **Payment Methods**
   - Kotak QR: ₹200
   - Kotak Swipe: ₹300
   - Debtors: ₹100
   - BharatPE: ₹50

4. **End of Day - Denominations**
   - Count cash and enter pieces
   - System calculates total

5. **Reconciliation**
   - **Debit Cash**: ₹5,500 (₹5,000 + ₹500)
   - **Collection**: ₹5,500 (cash + digital payments)
   - **Difference**: ₹0.00 ✅ Perfect!

---

## 🧮 Calculation Formulas

```javascript
Total Sale = SUM(all POS entries)

Debit Cash = Opening Cash + Total Sale

Net Amount = Debit Cash - (KQR + KSW + Debtors + BharatPE)

Collection = Denominations Total + KQR + KSW + Debtors + BharatPE

Difference = Debit Cash - Collection
```

**Goal**: Difference should be ₹0.00 for perfect reconciliation!
