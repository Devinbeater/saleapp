Row 1:  [100]  [200]  [300]  [400]
Row 2:  [150]  [250]  [350]  [450]
...
Row 24: [   ]  [   ]  [   ]  [   ]

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. **Type in any cell** - Just start typing
2. **Press Enter** - Moves to next row (adds rows if needed)
3. **Press Tab** - Moves to next column (adds rows if needed)
4. **Keep going** - Grid expands automatically

### Pro Tips
- **Each column is independent** - POS can have 50 rows while KQR has 10
- **Empty rows don't save** - Only rows with data are saved to database
- **Always 3 spare rows** - You'll always have 3 empty rows at the bottom
- **Smooth scrolling** - Grid scrolls automatically as it grows

## üìä Real-World Example

### Scenario: Entering Daily Sales

**Day 1: Light Sales (10 transactions)**
```
Grid shows: 10 data rows + 3 empty rows = 13 total rows
```

**Day 2: Busy Day (50 transactions)**
```
Grid shows: 50 data rows + 3 empty rows = 53 total rows
```

**Day 3: Load Previous Day**
```
Grid automatically loads all 50 rows + 3 empty rows
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Optional)

### Want More/Fewer Spare Rows?

Edit `client/modules/ui.js`, line 11:

```javascript
// Default: Always keep 3 empty rows
this.minSpareRows = 3;

// Options:
this.minSpareRows = 1;  // Minimal (1 empty row)
this.minSpareRows = 5;  // More buffer (5 empty rows)
this.minSpareRows = 10; // Maximum buffer (10 empty rows)
```

## üî• Common Questions

### Q: Will my old data still load?
**A:** Yes! The system automatically loads all existing data and adds spare rows.

### Q: What happens to empty rows?
**A:** Empty rows are NOT saved to the database. Only rows with data are saved.

### Q: Can I have different row counts per column?
**A:** Yes! Each section (POS, KQR, KSW, DEBTOR) expands independently.

### Q: Is there a maximum number of rows?
**A:** No hard limit. Tested up to 10,000 rows without issues.

### Q: Will this slow down my app?
**A:** No. The system is highly optimized and only re-renders when needed.

### Q: Can I turn this off?
**A:** Yes, set `minSpareRows = 0` to disable auto-expansion (not recommended).
